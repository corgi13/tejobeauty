# Performance Optimization Plan

This document outlines the performance optimization plan for the Tejo Beauty platform.

## 1. Database Query Optimization Strategies

*   **Indexing:** Ensure that all frequently queried columns are indexed.
*   **Query Analysis:** Use `EXPLAIN` to analyze and optimize slow queries.
*   **Connection Pooling:** Use a connection pool to manage database connections efficiently.

## 2. API Response Caching Techniques

*   **Cache-Aside Pattern:** Use a cache-aside pattern to cache frequently accessed data.
*   **ETags:** Use ETags to enable client-side caching.
*   **Content Delivery Network (CDN):** Use a CDN to cache static assets and API responses.

## 3. Frontend Bundle Optimization Methods

*   **Code Splitting:** Split the frontend code into smaller chunks to reduce the initial load time.
*   **Tree Shaking:** Remove unused code from the final bundle.
*   **Minification:** Minify the JavaScript and CSS files to reduce their size.

## 4. Image Optimization Approaches

*   **Image Compression:** Compress images to reduce their size without sacrificing quality.
*   **Responsive Images:** Use responsive images to serve different image sizes for different screen resolutions.
*   **Lazy Loading:** Lazy load images that are not visible in the viewport.

## 5. Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Implementation

*   **Next.js:** Use the built-in SSR capabilities of Next.js to improve the initial load time and SEO.
