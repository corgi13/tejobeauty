## 🧪 Testing & Verification

### Quick Test
```bash
cd mcp-servers
./test-all-servers.sh
```

### Individual Server Tests
```bash
# Test Fetch Server
python -m mcp_server_fetch --help

# Test Sequential Thinking Server
npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking --help
```

### VS Code Integration Test
1. Restart VS Code
2. Open an AI assistant (GitHub Copilot Chat, etc.)
3. Ask it to fetch a webpage or use sequential thinking
4. Verify the servers are working

## 💡 Example Workflows

### Competitive Analysis Workflow
```
AI Assistant: "Let's analyze our main competitor"

1. FETCH competitor's homepage
2. THINK through their value proposition
3. FETCH their product pages
4. THINK about pricing strategy differences
5. FETCH their about page
6. THINK about positioning differences
7. REVISE analysis with complete picture
8. DELIVER structured competitive analysis
```

### Product Launch Planning Workflow
```
AI Assistant: "Plan the launch of our new skincare line"

1. THINK about launch components needed
2. FETCH current beauty market trends
3. THINK about positioning opportunities
4. FETCH competitor launch strategies
5. THINK about differentiation approach
6. BRANCH into multiple launch scenarios
7. REVISE based on resource constraints
8. DELIVER comprehensive launch plan
```

### Technical Problem-Solving Workflow
```
AI Assistant: "Our checkout conversion dropped - investigate"

1. THINK about potential causes
2. FETCH current analytics data
3. THINK about patterns in the data
4. FETCH error logs and user feedback
5. BRANCH into different investigation paths
