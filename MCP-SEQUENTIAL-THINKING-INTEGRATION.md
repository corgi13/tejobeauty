## üîß Configuration

### Current Configuration
```json
{
    "servers": {
        "fetch": {
            "command": "python",
            "args": ["-m", "mcp_server_fetch"]
        },
        "sequential-thinking": {
            "command": "npx",
            "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking"]
        }
    }
}
```

### Customization Options

#### Disable Thought Logging
To disable the detailed logging of thoughts, you can set an environment variable:

```json
{
    "servers": {
        "sequential-thinking": {
            "command": "npx",
            "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking"],
            "env": {
                "DISABLE_THOUGHT_LOGGING": "true"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### Docker Alternative
For more isolation, you can use the Docker version:

```json
{
    "servers": {
        "sequential-thinking": {
            "command": "docker",
            "args": ["run", "--rm", "-i", "mcp/sequentialthinking"]
        }
    }
}
```

## üß™ Example Usage

### Basic Structured Thinking
Ask an AI assistant: "Use sequential thinking to plan our new product launch strategy"

The assistant will:
1. Break down the problem into thoughts
2. Consider multiple approaches
3. Revise thinking as new considerations arise
4. Maintain context across all steps
5. Provide a comprehensive final strategy

### Complex Problem-Solving
"Use sequential thinking to investigate why our checkout conversion rate dropped"

The process might include:
- Initial hypothesis formation
- Data gathering thoughts
- Analysis of different factors
- Revision of hypotheses based on findings
- Branching into multiple investigation paths
- Final conclusion with action items

### Design Decision Making
"Use sequential thinking to decide on our new website color scheme"

This could involve:
- Considering brand alignment
- Analyzing target audience preferences
- Exploring accessibility requirements
- Testing different combinations
- Revising based on feedback
- Final recommendation with rationale

## üõ†Ô∏è Tool Details

### Input Schema
The Sequential Thinking tool accepts:
- **thought**: Current thinking step (string)
- **thoughtNumber**: Current thought number (integer)
- **totalThoughts**: Estimated total thoughts needed (integer)
- **nextThoughtNeeded**: Whether another thought is needed (boolean)
- **isRevision**: Whether this revises previous thinking (optional boolean)
- **revisesThought**: Which thought is being reconsidered (optional integer)
- **branchFromThought**: Branching point (optional integer)
- **branchId**: Branch identifier (optional string)

### Output
The tool returns:
- Confirmation of thought processing
- Current thought status
- Branch information
- Thought history length

## üîÑ Integration with Fetch Server

The Sequential Thinking and Fetch servers work excellently together:

1. **Research Phase**: Use fetch to gather information
2. **Analysis Phase**: Use sequential thinking to analyze gathered data
3. **Iteration**: Fetch additional data based on thinking process
4. **Conclusion**: Structured final recommendations

Example workflow:
```
1. Fetch competitor data ‚Üí 
2. Think through analysis ‚Üí 
3. Fetch more specific data based on insights ‚Üí 
4. Revise thinking with new data ‚Üí 
5. Final strategic recommendations
```

## üß™ Testing

To test the Sequential Thinking server:

```bash
# Test basic availability
npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking --help

# Run installation script
./mcp-servers/install-sequential-thinking.sh  # Linux/macOS
./mcp-servers/install-sequential-thinking.bat  # Windows
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Node.js not found**: Install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/
2. **NPX issues**: Update npm with `npm install -g npm@latest`
3. **Permission denied**: Run `chmod +x mcp-servers/*.sh` for shell scripts
4. **VS Code not recognizing**: Restart VS Code after configuration changes

### Debug Information
Check the VS Code output panel for MCP-related logs and errors.

## üîí Best Practices

### Effective Use
- **Start Small**: Begin with simple problems to understand the flow
- **Be Specific**: Provide clear problem statements
- **Embrace Revision**: Don't hesitate to revise thoughts as understanding grows
- **Use Branching**: Explore multiple approaches when uncertain
- **Express Uncertainty**: It's okay to express doubt and explore alternatives

### Performance Considerations
- Complex thinking processes may take time
- Consider breaking very large problems into smaller sub-problems
- Use appropriate total thought estimates
